# Fast-Large-Image-Object-Detection-yolov7
## Introduction
Processing large area of (satellite and aerial) requires large computational time. Fast-Large-Image-Object-Detection-yolov7 aims to process multiple large size satellite and aerial images using yolov7 as object detector. Using this system one can process large hundreds of kilometers of area in minutes.
